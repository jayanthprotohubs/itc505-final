                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Turn off all the lights on the game board to win.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Clicking a light toggles it and its adjacent lights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Starting Configuration:</strong> The game board starts with random lights on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Winning Condition:</strong> You win when all lights are turned off.</li>
                        <li><strong>Levels:</strong> Choose a difficulty level before starting the game.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Rules and Strategies:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Experiment with different sequences of clicks to find the optimal strategy for each level.</li>
                        <li>Remember that clicking a light will also affect neighboring lights.</li>
                        <li>Strive for efficiency, as fewer clicks will lead to a faster victory.</li>
                        <li>Keep track of your time and try to beat your previous records.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Level Selection:</h3>
                    <p>Each difficulty level offers a unique challenge:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> A 3x3 grid for a quick warm-up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> A 5x5 grid with more complexity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hard:</strong> A 7x7 grid for the ultimate challenge.</li>
                    </ul>
